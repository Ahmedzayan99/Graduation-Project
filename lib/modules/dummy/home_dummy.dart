        details: "Seated dumbbell shoulder press This exercise targets the anterior, lateral and posterior deltoids (with an emphasis on the middle deltoids). Meanwhile, lifting two separate dumbbells (as opposed to using a machine) prevents you from using one side of your body over the other, thus maintaining a more stable balance and distribution. Of course, a fair amount of coordination is needed to pull this off, especially when you're increasing the weights.How to perform the exercise:1- Sit on a low bench and hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level, palms facing forward. Keeping your head and spine completely straight.2- Lift the dumbbells at the top towards each other, while stopping to touch them at the top.3- Pause for a few seconds and then carefully reverse the movement.",
